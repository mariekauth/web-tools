        <h1>Web Tools</h1>
        <p>
            This is the beginning of our new web based toolbox.
        </p>
        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Quickly develop web tools using MVP (Mininum Viable Product)</li>
            <li>Create tools that will help me write code in multiple languages with the minimal amount of effort.</li>
            <li>Demonstrate the ability to use Git and GitHub.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Current Tools</h2>
        <h3><a href="model-writer.htm">Object Oriented Model Writer</a></h3>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="waterfall-example.php">Procedural programming</a>, also 
            known as water-fall, gives the computer instruction line by line. 
            It is faster to write initially, but often does not lend itself 
            well to code re-use.
        </p>
        <p>
            An Object Oriented approach often allows you to write things once, 
            but use them multiple times. It takes a little longer to write 
            initially, but due to the re-usablity of the code ultimately makes 
            development a bit faster and more reliable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first tool I wrote allows me to write the PHP Models using the 
            PSR Standards from <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/">PHP-Fig</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Next</h2>
        <p>
            I decided that this would be a great project to put on github to 
            demonstrate the use of Version Control Software as well as Team 
            Collaboration. The server side object that currently writes the 
            PHP Objects will be useful for actually writing the model 
            files in a development folder before deploying. However, 
            the working demonstration lends itself better to being parsed 
            completely in JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently support is only for writing PHP Models and makes a call 
            to the server. We are going to update the code to be parsed 
            entirely in JavaScript with no need to make a call back to the 
            server. My daughter, Shelby Kauth, and I have chosen to work on 
            this project together.
        </p>
        <h2>Completed Tasks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Set up Word Press Blog (Marie March 6, 2017)</li>
            <li>Create site at http://marie.kauths.com</li>
            <li>Create PHP Class that will allow us to easily write PHP Models. (Marie March 6, 2017)</li>
            <li>Add ability to fill out web-form, submit it and call the classs. (Marie March 6, 2017)</li>
            <li>Create GitHub Repository (Marie Kauth 3/7/2017)</li>
            <li>Commit Model-Writer to write PHP models (Marie Kauth 3/7/2017)</li>
            <li>Add a drop-down that will choose which language to create the object for. (Shelby 3/7/2017)</li>
            <li>Move JS to separate File (Shelby 3/7/2017)</li>
            <li>Create a JavaScript form getter. This will allow us to update the fields now without having to update the code to the new fields later (Shelby March 7, 2017)</li>
            <li>Re-parse the PHP version using JavaScript. (Shelby 3/8/2017 - Merged 3/9/2017)</li>
            <li>Add support for VB.Net, C#.Net, and possibly Classic VB (Marie)</li>
            <li>
                Re-do Propert Type fields to be selected from a drop-down. This will require 
                adding a field at the top allow adding custom property types to ensure we can 
                connect the objects. (Shelby 3/8/2017)
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the Remove Model Property button, and instead add it to the property type
                drop down, allowing easier readability, faster input, and just making it look better. (Shelby 3/8/2017)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Pending Tasks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Add support for VB.Net (Marie)</li>
            <li>Add support for C#.Net (Marie)</li>
            <li>Add support for Class VB (Marie)</li>
            <li>Add support for C++ (Shelby)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Completion Process</h2>
        <p>
            Each of the above tasks is a separate entity. 
            Please do not try to work on more than one task at once.
            Each of these items should be pushed to GitHub as soon as completed, so it 
            will be available as needed for some of the related tasks.
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose of this exercise</h2>
        <p>
            Provide a simple tool that will help us develop the object models in multiple languages,
            while demonstrating the ability to use version contol software, 
            git from the command line interface,
            team collaboration, stay on task, and provide viable product in a minimal amount of time.
        </p>
        <h2>How this came about</h2>
        <p>
            On Monday I found myself unemployed and without an up to date 
            portfolio. So, I decided to write a tool that would allow to 
            track the jobs I am interested in, and each interaction with the 
            contacts. This would make a great portfolio project as well as 
            a useful tool that has been requested of me several times in the 
            past.
        </p>
        <p>
            To demonstrate my abilities to write in Object Oriented PHP using 
            an MVC layout I started by creating the company model.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having only a text editor as a development tool on this 
            machine I realize that this is going to take a while to create each 
            model along with the proper comments that will allow intellisense 
            from a more robust editor to work correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, I quickly whipped up a controller that would write the model 
            if sent an array.
