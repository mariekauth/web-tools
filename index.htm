        <h1>Marie Kauth</h1>
        <p>
            On March 6, 2017 I lost my job and find myself without an up to date 
            web portfolio. Over the past 6 months I have struggled greatly 
            because I was learning a lot of new skills at once and did not 
            have the opportunity to digest all that I had learned.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a lot of new skillsets and seeing things from a different 
            view I am taking stock of what I know, and creating a new portfolio
            that will demonstrate, at least to the most basic level, my 
            understanding of each of thos skills.
        </p>
        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Quickly develop web tools using MVP (Mininum Viable Product)</li>
            <li>Demonstrate the ability to write Object Oriented code in multiple programming languages.</li>
            <li>Create tools that will help me write code in multiple languages with the minimal amount of effort.</li>
            <li>Demonstrate the ability to use Git and GitHub.</li>
            <li>Allow future employers to be able to see how I work and how I think</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Please keep in mind that at this time this is only a DRAFT. 
            Normally, you would not post your draft to the Web EVER. I am doing 
            so for very specific reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
            My ultimate goal here is to get a job. To properly update my 
            resume I need to take stock of the skills I currently have and 
            what level they are really at. I also would like to have a tool box 
            that I can take with me from company to company for when the company 
            I am working for does not have those tools already available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Programming is an area where only the end product is available. 
            Perspective employers have no way of knowing how a candidate thinks, 
            how long a project takes for a candidate to complete, by what method 
            they came up with the completed project.
        </p>
        <p>
            My thought is that I can hone my git and scrum skills, access my 
            current levels in each area, demonstrate my skills and abilities, 
            show perspective employers how I think and how I work, get my 
            resume updated, develop my toolbox, and find a job all at the same 
            time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Posting at GitHub, and posting many of my 'Drafts' as live allows me 
            to do all of the above. Once this particular project is completed 
            drafts will no longer be posted to this site, but only finished 
            projects.
        </p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Today is March 10, 2017 and I have spent the week doing several things:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Monday, March 6, 2017</dt>
                <dd>Updated my KeePass software as well as my online passwords</dd>
                <dd>Set up work press <a href="http://blog.kauths.com">blog</a></dd>
                <dd>After writing a simple word press blog, I realized two things. 
                    First, I did not set it up correctly to be used as a network 
                    of word press blogs. Second, I really did not want to work  
                    with Word Press blogs as my primary focus.
                <dd>
                    Started to create a system to track job leads. I figured if
                    wrote it using an Object Oriented Approach I could even 
                    use it as part of my portfolio, or when perspective job leads 
                    asked for a snipped of code.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    After writing the first model, I realized I needed a 
                    better way to quickly write the models (since I am using a 
                    basic text editor).
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    I quickly wrote a page the would write the models for me 
                    if I simply changed the variables.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    The I decided it would be much faster if I made the writer 
                    itself an object. This made me realize it would be an 
                    excellent project to put on gitHub. I could also use this 
                    as an example of my ability to use git.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    In order to use this on the web as an example, I would also 
                    need a form input to demonstrate a working example.
                </dd>
                <dd>I quickly whipped up a form, and had it work with the PHP form.</dd>
            <dt>Tuesday, March 7, 2017</dt>
                <dd>I set-up the project on GitHub</dd>
                <dd>I decided that if this was going to be a form and a GitHub
                    project, then I could do a coouple things with it.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    This could be used to demonstrate git useage while cementing 
                    what I have learned about working with git.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    The goal here is to help both myself and my daughter get 
                    a viable web portfolio ready to help both of us get a job. 
                    Shelby has a lot of skill, but no professional work experience. 
                    She is always working on projects but has no way of really 
                    demonstrating her skills. I had recommended GitHub to her 
                    because she openly embraces the Open Source Software world.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    This brought me to realize that this was an excellent 
                    opportunity to teach Shelby how to use git while demonstrating 
                    Team Collaboration and SCRUM.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    For a GitHub project it would also be useful to make the 
                    objects write in other languages. This would be useful for 
                    my portfolio.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    The combination of looking at the form as an example and 
                    bringing Shelby in on the project did two things. We realized 
                    that the form did not look great, and Shelby wanted to 
                    demonstrate some of her JavaScript skills.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    The focus changed from getting the form ready quickly to 
                    write my models to demonstrate (OOP) Object Oriented 
                    Programming in multiple languages, following PSR standards 
                    and developing for IDE (Integrated Development Environment) 
                    so the comments will picked up by the Intellisense
                    to instead focusing on demonstrating Git and SCRUM.
                </dd>
            <dt>Wednesday, March 8, 2017</dt>
                <dd>
                    I integrated Slak with GitHub to allow Shelby and I to 
                    collaborate on the project better, and ensure that I could 
                    in fact create web hooks and integrations.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    Continued processing the git requests. Continued seeking 
                    job opportities I am interested in, and followed up on job leads.
                </dd>
            <dt>Thursday, March 9, 2017</dt>
                <dd>
                    Followed up with several job leads. Continued managing 
                    Shelby on GitHub.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    Several of the job leads look very promising and I am 
                    hoping to have a job by the end of next week.
                </dd>
            <dt>Friday, March 10, 2017</dt>
                <dd>
                    Clean this up to make it a bit neater
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    Finishing taking stock of my current skillsets and skill 
                    levels.
                </dd>
                <dd>
                    Working on completing my changes to my resume.
