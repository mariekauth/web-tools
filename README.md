##Purpose - Demonstration - Developing a toolbox
This Project was started on Monday, March 6, 2017. 

The purpose is simple:
 1. Demonstrate the ability to use versioning control software such as GIT
 2. Learn more of git's advanced features to be more prepared for jobs in the
    future.
 3. Demonstrate the functional use of multiple programming languages.
 4. Create a toolbox for developing code quicker, especially when all you 
    have is a basic text editor like vi, vim, or notepad++
 5. Collaborate on a project.

##Info 
This project is being 'thrown' together quickly. The development version of 
it is being hosted live for the purpose of demonstrating how we work. Once 
the first project (model-writer) is complete it is unlikely that the development
version will remain live.
